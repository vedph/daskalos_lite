Daskalos quizzes are built on a minimalist approach, to provide easy to run quizzes in a simple web browser, without any backend. Each quiz is fed by a simple JSON file. Daskalos quizzes allow custom HTML content, questions with timeout, single or multiple answers, custom answers scoring, and flow branching. A quiz flows through a sequence of steps. Each step has any number of choices. Each choice gives its own contribution to the final score, defined as a number which can be either positive or negative. The quiz is passed when the total score (=the sum of the scores of all the selected choices) is greater than or equal to the minimum score defined for it.</div>",

Quiz creators can specify a time-limited question by simply setting the <em>number of seconds</em> allowed before the quiz automatically skips to the step defined as the <em>next step after a timeout</em>.</div>",
